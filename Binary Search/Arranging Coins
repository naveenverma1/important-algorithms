Arranging Coins

You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:

n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
Example 2:

n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.


Solution

class Solution {
    public int arrangeCoins(int n) {
       long left  = 0;
        long right = n;
        long a,mid;
        while(left<=right){
             mid = left +(right-left)/2;
             a = (mid*(mid+1))/2; 
            if(n==a) {return (int)mid;}    
            if(n<a) {right = mid-1;}
            else {left = mid +1;}
        }
           return (int)right;
        }
    }
