Given a string s consisting only of characters a, b and c.

Return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b and c.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabc"
Output: 10
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc", "bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc" (again). 
Example 2:

Input: s = "aaacb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "aaacb", "aacb" and "acb". 
Example 3:

Input: s = "abc"
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

3 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^4
s only consists of a, b or c characters.

Solution:

class Solution {
    public int numberOfSubstrings(String s) {
        int i =0;
        int j;
      int[] count ={0,0,0};
        int res=0;
        for( j =0;j<s.length();++j){
            ++count[s.charAt(j)-'a'];
            
            while(count[0]>0&& count[1]>0&& count[2]>0){
                --count[s.charAt(i++)-'a'];}
               res+=i; 
            
        }
        return res;
    }
}
